# 🚀 Server Status

## Starting Development Server...

The server is starting up. This may take 10-30 seconds on first run.

### What to expect:

1. **First 10-15 seconds:** Server is compiling
2. **Then you'll see:** "Ready on http://localhost:3000"
3. **Open browser:** Go to http://localhost:3000

## If you see errors in the terminal:

**Common issues:**

1. **Port 3000 already in use:**
   - Another app is using port 3000
   - Solution: Close that app or change port

2. **Module not found:**
   - Run: `npm install`

3. **Database connection error:**
   - Check `.env` file has correct DATABASE_URL

## Once server is running:

✅ You should see: "Ready on http://localhost:3000"  
✅ Open browser: http://localhost:3000  
✅ You should see: The Champions homepage
